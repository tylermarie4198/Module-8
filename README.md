# Module-8
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room. They previously had previously had a game but they wanted to make their game be web based and availible across different platforms. They initially only had it avalible through an app on Andriods.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did the coding part pretty well. I made sure I kept everything as condense yet effecient as I could.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I definitely found the chart from project 2 the most helpful. It helped organize a lot of different characteristics from the different platforms and helped me see ups and downs with each.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would pick the chart from Project 2. I would work on revising this because I would love to dive even deeper so I am able to apply it to real life clients. I would improve it by actually going through the process of building apps so I can get accurate costs and see hands on the ups and downs of the different platforms

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I made sure to first read the users needs and then gave choices. It is very important to consider the users needs because you want them to utilize the work that you worked so hard on. You also want the client to be happy and satified so you can have a good reputation and gain more clientele. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I used the UML diagram to design this software. In the future I will still use the UML diagram as well as psuedocode to analyze and design a similar software application.
